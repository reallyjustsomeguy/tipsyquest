# TipsyQuest - Quest Compatible Drunk Effect Shader for VRChat

------------------

# What is it? 
TipsyQuest Shader is my creation of a Drunk Effect Shader for VRChat, born out of necessity because there wasn't an existing shader out there that was Free, Fully Featured, Easy to Implement, and most importantly that was QUEST COMPATIBLE!

------------------

# Demo World
https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_9b100b09-ec37-4268-acf7-3fb6ad2569ee/info

------------------

# What Does it Do?
Screen distortion effects of waves, tilting, zooming, and Chromatic Aberration. All with multiple strength and speed controls.
Texture and Color overlay options, with scrolling, distortion, etc. to personalize for drink variants (like floating bubbles texture, frost, stars, etc...)
"Eye Closing" slider overlay from top and bottom of screen for scriptable blinking or blacking-out from too much...
After they're set, all effects can simply be faded-in by a udon script at the same time by only increasing the _Opacity value.
Comes in an optimized hard-coded version, and an easy to edit visual node version made in and editable with Amplify Shader Editor from the Unity store.

------------------

# How Do I Use it?
Get it on my github, it's free for anyone and can be used in commercial projects, just please attribute me in your credits. This is just the shader, but it is commly placed on a sphere that is constrained locally around the player's head by a udon script, with each drink increasing the _Opacity value, untill eventually fading away or "blacking-out" with a player teleport...

# But I dunno how to do that...
While the shader provided here is free, a ready-to-go drink system using it can be purchased from my friend ValenVRC at: https://valenvrc.gumroad.com/l/AlcoholSystem
